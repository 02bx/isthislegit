# About

IsThisLegit is a tool that makes it easy to collect, analyze, categorize, and respond to phishing emails for your organization.

It consists of two parts:

* **Chrome Extension** - The Chrome extension, when installed on managed Chrome instances, adds a button to Gmail that makes it easy for users to report phishing emails to the IsThisLegit dashboard.
* **Dashboard** - The dashboard (currently a Google App Engine application) is the analyst's window into phishing reports from the organization. Analysts can use the dashboard to view, categorize, and respond to phishing emails.

# Installation
